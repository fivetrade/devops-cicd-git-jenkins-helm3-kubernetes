# Install and Use Helm 3 on Kubernetes Cluster and jankins server
## Helm2 vs Helm3
#### Tiller is Removed
The most apparent change is the removal of Tiller. The server-side component, Tiller, is now removed.
Why was tiller removed then?
Previously, Helm 2  takes the maximum permission to make changes in Kubernetes. This can cause security issues in the cluster if Helm has not been properly deployed.
##### Tiller is Removed Helm v2 vs v3 commands
example 
| Command | Helm2 | Helm3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Download a chart to your local directory	| fetch	| pull |
| Given a release name, delete the release from Kubernetes | delete| uninstall |

helm search repo bitnami
````
#### Add Helm 3 ** ON node Master (kubernetes cluster)

kubectl config get-contexts
````
Switch to desired cluster context

kubectl config use-context context-name
````
