# Installation et configurationde Helm3 in jankins server
#### Helm2 vs Helm3
##### Tiller is Removed
The most apparent change is the removal of Tiller. The server-side component, Tiller, is now removed.
Why was tiller removed then?
Previously, Helm 2  takes the maximum permission to make changes in Kubernetes. This can cause security issues in the cluster if Helm has not been properly deployed.

| Command | Helm2 | Helm3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Download a chart to your local directory	| fetch	| pull |
